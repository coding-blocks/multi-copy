# Multi Copy
An Android app to copy multiple texts together.
To use it, just long press on any text and select "multi copy" from context menu. You can select and copy multiple times and your previous copies will not erase. It will get stored in a list. Copied text can be seen in the dialog when you select "multi copy".
After you copy text you can do multiple things with the text such as add texts to notes, or delete copied texts and start a new clip.

You can use Smart Copy after enabling it on app. It will enhance the regular copy function to copy multiple texts together and to paste all the copied text together.
Don't forget to disable smart copy after use.
